			I’ve always been the kind of person who's driven to make things and fix problems. It’s why I write fiction, why I doodle on random pieces of paper, why I keep a list of useful apps I'd like to make one day.
		</p> 

		<p>
			Whenever I read or watch or use something awesome, I feel a little pang of jealousy, wishing that <em>I'd</em> written that novel, directed that movie, or designed that app. And whenever I see something that doesn’t work quite as well as it should, I itch to fix it.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>That’s why I want to become a web developer.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			You see, it's been nearly four years since I graduated with a B.S. in English, and while I've had a decent job in the meantime, I’m tired of not being in a position to "put a ding in the universe." I’m tired of watching from the sidelines and feeling insignificant while people create things like Twitter, PayPal, and Basecamp.
		</p>

			But breaking into the world of software development isn’t easy when you arrive late to the game armed with a liberal arts degree. Learning to code is one thing - but learning to be part of a development team, adhere to best practices, and create software in a disciplined, efficient manner? Those aren’t things you get from a book. Those are things you learn by seeking out and working with the best.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			That's where you come in. You are a group of top-notch developers. You are <%= link_to 'active', 'https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl', :target => '_blank' %>, <%= link_to 'contributing', 'https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip', :target => '_blank' %> members of the Ruby/Rails community, and you teach other people to do what you do. You are exactly what I've been searching for.
		</p>
		
		<h2>This site is a demo</h2>
		
		<p>
			I built this site from the ground up for the sole purpose of applying to apprentice.io. It's got a <%= link_to 'simple but functional blog', blog_path %>, complete with a post <%= link_to 'creation', new_post_path %> and management <%= link_to 'interface', posts_path %>, basic user access levels, and nice-looking post URLs. Please take some time to <%= link_to 'put it to the test', blog_path %>. You can also <%= link_to 'view the source code', 'https://github.com/jeffreyftang/bumblelog', :target => '_blank' %> on GitHub.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			It's nothing spectacular, but I hope it's a convincing demonstration of what I can do - and how hard I'm willing to work for this opportunity.
