		<p>I’ve always been the kind of person who likes to solve problems. I love challenges that I can sink my whole brain into, that suck me in for hours on end, exhilarating and frustrating all at once.</p>

		<p>At the same time, I’m driven to make things. It’s why I write fiction, why I doodle on random pieces of paper, why I keep a list of little useful apps that I’d like to write one day.  Whenever I read or watch or use something awesome, I feel a little pang of jealousy, wishing that I had been the one to write that novel, or direct that movie, or design that app. And whenever I see something that doesn’t work quite as well as it should, I itch to fix it.</p>

		<p>That’s why I want need to become a web developer. Its been four years since I graduated with a BS in English, and while I've had a decent job in the meantime, I’m tired of not being in a position to "put a ding in the universe." I’m tired of watching from the sidelines and feeling insignificant while people develop things like Twitter, PayPal, and Basecamp. I want an opportunity to work on and create things I can be proud of.</p>

		<p>But breaking into the world of software development isn’t easy when you arrive late to the game armed with a liberal arts degree.
Learning to code is one thing - but learning to be part of a development team, to adhere to industry best practices, to create software in a disciplined, efficient manner? Those aren’t things you get from a book. Those are things you learn by seeking out and working with the best.</p>
		
		<p>That's where you come in. You are a group of top-notch developers. You associate with other people and companies I admire. You are active, contributing members of the Ruby/Rails community, and you teach other people to do what you do. You are exactly what I've been searching for.</p>
		
		<p>#</p>

		
		<p>I built this site from the ground up for the sole purpose of applying to apprentice.io. It's got a simple but functional blog, complete with control panel, user account creation and access levels, and basic admin capabilities. Please take some time to put it to the test. You can also view the source code on GitHub.</p>

		
		<p>It's not a work of genius or anything, but I hope it's a convincing demonstration of what I can do - and how hard I'm willing to work for this opportunity.</p>
